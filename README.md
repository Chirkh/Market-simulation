# Market-simulation
This program creates a simple market simulation. Every trading day starts with a number of sellers and buyers. Depending on whether a buyer or seller makes a transaction, they adjust their asking prices for the next day (dependent on their surplus). Each buyer object is given a max price it is willing to pay and each seller is given a min price that it needs to sell. If the max price of a buyer is greater than the min price of the seller then they make a trade. The price of the transaction is normally distributed with mean equal to the halfway point between the min selling price and the max buying price. After the day, if a buyer has bought something he will set his new max buying price to slightly above the price he paid (This amount above the price is modulated by the surplus of the buyer) but below his max price for the previos day, similarly if a seller sells he will raise his min price to slighly below the price that he transacted for the day before. If a buyer does not buy he will increase the max price he is willing to pay for the next day. If a seller does not sell he will decrease his min asking price. If a seller does not sell for a certain number of days in a row then he becomes bankrupt and is removed from the market. The idea for this simulation came from this video by Primer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8

This is an example of the type of output the simulation produces:

Initially as the supply is greater than the demand the average price falls and since a lot of sellers can't sell they become bankrupt. When the number of sellers becomes roughly equal to the number of buyers the price stops falling and begins to level out/increase. Due to the random nature in which the buyers pick their sellers each day sellers continue to decrease until they are just below the number of buyers. The demand is greater then the supply and the price shoots up.
